<p>I didn't ask why my parents named me Summer until I was 7 years old. My parents had been seperated for as long as I could remember but my mother was more than happy to call my father so they could both tell me the story. I was conceived on the first day of summer. Much to my 7 year old dismay they took great joy in sharing too many details. That sums up my childhood.</p>

   <p> By the end of the class I will be better at telling my story. Currently I tend to ramble and go on tangents about my cat. His name is Caesar. He was abandoned by his forest family when he got a horrid tick infection. He was hypothermic and weighed less than 1 lb when I found him. Now he is a 15 lb monster. </p>
