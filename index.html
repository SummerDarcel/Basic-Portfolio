<p>I didn't ask why my parents named me Summer until I was 7 years old. My parents had been seperated for as long as I could remember but my mother was more than happy to call my father so they could both tell me the story. I was conceived on the first day of summer. Much to my 7 year old dismay they took great joy in sharing too many details. That sums up my childhood.</p>

   <p> By the end of the class I will be better at telling my story. Currently I tend to ramble and go on tangents about my cat. His name is Caesar. He was abandoned by his forest family when he got a horrid tick infection. He was hypothermic and weighed less than 1 lb when I found him. Now he is a 15 lb monster. </p>

    <p>Nulla tempor ornare diam, vitae volutpat erat bibendum eget. Nunc sagittis placerat velit sit amet interdum. Nam in iaculis purus, quis tristique velit. Cras ut nisl vitae orci malesuada placerat non sed magna.
